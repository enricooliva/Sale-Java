Test project:
* Triangulation (adding special case tests with new inputs in order to justify generaling algorithm)
* Removing Duplication (hardcoded data duplicated between production code and tests)

Removing duplication --> MVC (Model View Control) structure emerge
Focusiong on improving naming --> redistribute responsibility

Structures need names, which we need to improve
Better names lead to bigger abstractions
Bigger abstractions help us see more, bigger duplication

Structure emerge --> structure need names --> improve names --> abstraction emerge --> higher-level duplication
--> remove duplication

remvoe duplication --> improve names

Compose method
Divide your program into methods that perform one identifiable task. Keep all of the operations in a method at the same level of abstraction.
This will naturally result in programs with many small methods, each a few lines long.
